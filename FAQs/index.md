# Technical 
<p style="margin-top:30px;"></p>

<details>
<summary> Does ACENji make native mobile apps?</summary>

Yes, ACENji is specifically designed to enable the creation of native mobile apps for both Google Play and the Apple Store. We offer two primary methods for publishing your apps to these platforms.  
  
Firstly, we have a built-in global 'super app'. This is a default app that can be found on both Google Play and the Apple Store, within which users can build an unlimited number of apps. These apps are instantly accessible by any designated users.  
  
Secondly, we are working on providing a white label solution that allows self-deployment of individual apps. These apps will be self-served on Google Play and Apple's App Store. This allows for greater branding control and direct app management.  
</details>  
  
   
<p style="margin-top:30px;"></p>
<details>
<summary> How many users can use my app simultaneously?</summary>

ACENji supports elastic expansion according to your specific needs and the terms of your license contract with us.   
Our systems are designed to scale seamlessly, expanding capacity as demand increases.   
This means we're equipped to handle all your users simultaneously, regardless of the number.   
The actual user limit would depend on the specific contract terms and system resources allocated to your application.</details>

<p style="margin-top:30px;"></p>
<details>
<summary> Would created apps work offline?</summary>

Absolutely, apps created with ACENji are designed to function offline. They can operate effectively without an internet connection for a certain period of time.   
As soon as internet access is available, these apps are designed to synchronize and update their data in real-time. This means your app remains functional and up-to-date, regardless of your users' connectivity.</details>

<p style="margin-top:30px;"></p>
<details>
<summary> Do you also offer individual app development as an agency service?</summary>

Yes, while ACENji itself is a no-code app-building platform, we understand that some clients may prefer to have their apps professionally developed.   
For this reason, we have established partnerships with a number of web and marketing agencies. These agencies specialize in app development using ACENji's platform, enabling them to cater to your individual needs and requirements.</details>  
  

<p style="margin-top:30px;"></p>
<details>
<summary> Can I submit my ACENji apps to the Apple AppStore and Google Play Store?</summary>

Yes, you can submit your ACENji apps to both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. If your apps are part of ACENji's super app, we handle the submission process for you. Any changes to your apps will appear instantly on both platforms under the umbrella of the ACENji super app.

If you prefer to publish your apps as standalone entities, ACENji also supports this. You can submit your individual apps through ACENji to both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Please note, however, that they will be subject to the usual review and approval process of these platforms.</details>  



<p style="margin-top:30px;"></p>
<details>
<summary> How long will it take until my app is available?</summary>

For apps that are part of ACENji's super app, the availability is almost instant. Your apps should be usable directly from the Apple AppStore and Google Play Store within a few milliseconds of publishing.  

However, for standalone apps published independently, the timeframe largely depends on the review processes of Apple and Google. These processes can vary, but typically it could take anywhere from an hour to a few days before your app is available for download.</details>  





<p style="margin-top:30px;"></p>
<details>
<summary> Once I publish an app, does the app update the app content in real-time?</summary>

Definitely. For apps that are part of the super app, updates to the app content are pushed in real-time, taking only milliseconds to reflect on the Google Play and Apple App Store.  
  
If you have published your app independently, the standard process for updating a new release applies according to the guidelines set by Google Play and the Apple App Store. This might involve a review and approval process by these platforms, which could affect the timing of the updates becoming available to your users.</details>  


  





<p style="margin-top:30px;"></p>
<details>
<summary> Will the apps and websites still work if I cancel my account?</summary>

Apps and websites created using ACENji are typically governed by a license agreement, which usually lasts for a duration of one to two years.   
If you initiate a cancellation process, rest assured that your apps and websites will continue to function until the expiration of your current license. However, please note that no renewal will be issued once your license expires if the account is in the process of cancellation.</details>  




<p style="margin-top:30px;"></p>
<details>
<summary> Can I integrate database / login functionality? Where do I find the documentation?</summary>

While single sign-on functionality is not yet available, ACENji does offer robust data integration options.   
You can connect your app to up to 30 different data sources, including various databases. The system is designed to synchronize your data with the apps in real-time.  

As for the documentation, it's typically located within the developer section of our website.   
You should find comprehensive guides and resources there to help you get started and to troubleshoot any issues you might encounter. If you need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to our customer support team.</details>
