# üóÇÔ∏è Mini Apps

## What Are Mini Apps?

In ACENji, **Mini Apps** are self-contained applications that can work independently or blend seamlessly into a larger **super app**.  
They combine the simplicity of forms with the power of connected apps‚Äîwithout the limitations of either.

### üìä Comparison: Forms vs. Traditional Apps vs. Mini Apps

| Feature / Type | Forms | Traditional Standalone Apps | **Mini Apps (ACENji)** |
| -------------- | ----- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Setup** | Built into OS or web pages; quick to make but limited. | Separate installation & frequent updates needed. | Instantly available inside the super app; no separate install. |
| **Data Sharing** | None ‚Äî each form works in isolation. | Rare and usually manual; different apps don‚Äôt talk easily. | Real-time sharing between mini apps and users. |
| **User Access** | Single-purpose, no authentication. | Separate login per app. | Unified login across all mini apps in ACENji. |
| **Workflow Complexity** | Linear, single task. | Can be complex, but siloed from other apps. | Can describe multi-step workflows across mini apps. |
| **Compliance & Updates** | Not applicable. | Requires users to maintain latest versions & compatible hardware. | Always up-to-date inside the super app environment. |
| **Reporting** | Manual export (if any). | Often locked or complex to generate. | Built-in reporting in PDF/CSV with email/SMS delivery. |

### üöÄ Why Mini Apps Are Better
Mini Apps bridge the gap between the speed of forms and the capability of traditional apps‚Äîwhile removing their biggest drawbacks.  
They enable **modular, interactive, and scalable** solutions that keep everyone on the same page without extra installs, updates, or logins.
