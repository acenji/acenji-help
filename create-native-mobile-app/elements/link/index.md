# Link Element

The URL Link with Text element is used to provide or access a web address by clicking on a hyperlink with a custom text label. Link elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. Users are familiar with URLs, also known as links. You can also use options to customize the appearance of the hyperlink, such as changing the color or underline style of the text label.

## Links come with the following attributes:

- **Question Text:** A freestyle, multiline text field that is read-only. It indicates to the end-user what information they need to add as input.  

- **Optional:** Indicates whether this element is mandatory to be filled in at run time. By default, this is not selected and therefore the element is mandatory.  

- **Text:** The user can specify what the link text should read.  

- **URL:** By default, the value is #. Users can specify any public URL, such as https://acenji.com.  

- **Element Size:** This field is empty by default. Users can add a numerical value here to indicate the size of the info message in pixels. The lower the size, the more lines are allocated to the text in order to define that size as a box on the canvas.  

- **Inline:** This is a handy feature. If selected, the element gets glued to the previous element on the canvas. If there is no space to add it to the previous element, it positions itself with its own dimensions at the beginning of the canvas on the row where it is located. The next element can then be glued to it.
