# Camera Element

The camera element is used to allow users to capture visual data using their device's camera. 
Camera elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. Users can take multiple **images** or short **videos**. The element is designed to accommodate a variety of device types and camera resolutions and any specific device requirements are clearly communicated. You can also add options to customize the appearance of the element, such as changing the size or color of the camera viewfinder.

## It comes with the following attributes


- **Question Text:** Freestyle, multiline text. The text field is read-only and indicates to the end-user what action will follow if they press the button.  

- **Optional:** Indicates if this element is mandatory to be filled in at run time. By default, this is not selected, and therefore the element is optional.  

- **Multiple:** By default, it is selected, indicating that multiple pictures or videos can be taken.  

- **Slider Mode:** By default, it is selected, indicating that images/videos appear in a single box, and the user can navigate left and right to see others.  

- **Access to the Camera:** Images and videos are stored with a fully accessible static URL that is provided later in reports. Video lengths are limited to 15 seconds.  


When the app is opened, the user is presented with two requests: one for access to the camera and the second for the microphone.
