# Rating Element

The Rating element is used to rate a product, service, or experience using a set of stars. Rating elements can be used in both **Forms** and **Cards** to allow users to rate certain questions on a scale. The rating typically ranges from 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest rating. The values are represented by stars that function as buttons; if the user clicks on the second star, the first two stars will be filled to indicate the selection. The rating element is designed to be simple and intuitive, with clear instructions and feedback.

## This element has the following attributes:

- **Question Text:** a freestyle, multiline text field that is read-only. It informs the user what information is required for the input.  

- **Default Value:** By default, this element is optional. Information can be added at design time or at run time via the calculated field function (see below).   
The default value is set to 'empty' to provide a hint to the user. Users can choose from 'empty', '1', '2', '3', '4', or '5' as values.  

- **Optional:** Indicates whether this element is mandatory to be filled at run time. By default, this option is not selected, and therefore the element is mandatory.
