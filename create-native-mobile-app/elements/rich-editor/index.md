# Rich Editor Element

The Rich Editor element allows to create formatted content with rich text, images, videos, tables, and more. Rich Editor elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. There is a small difference when used in Forms vs Cards. In Cards, one card has one rich text editor, whereas in Forms, there can be multiple rich text editors but each one has to be on a separate page. The idea is to provide the user with the ability to use a rich text editor that gives them the experience of a writing environment.

## It comes with the following attributes:

- **Optional:** Indicates if this element is mandatory to be filled in at runtime. By default, this is not selected and therefore the element is mandatory.  

- **Placeholder:** Indicates if some placeholder text needs to be placed in advance.

## When using rich editor elements in Acenji, keep these tips in mind:  
  
1. When using the Rich Editor element, please note that the formatting options may be limited to ensure that the content fits within the platform's design. This means that certain font sizes, colors, or styles may not be available.  
  
2. To create rich content, you can use a third-party plugin like TinyMCE or CKEditor. These plugins provide additional features and can save development time. Make sure to select a plugin that is up-to-date and compatible with your platform.
