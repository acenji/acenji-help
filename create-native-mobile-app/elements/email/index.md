# Email Element

The Send Email element is used to allow users to send emails from within the platform. Email elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. The user typically enters the recipient's email address, subject, and message, and then clicks a button to send the email. It simply gives the user the ability to send an email at runtime with a few options: preloaded emails, access to the contact library to extract an email, or type it. <p style="margin-top:50px;"></p>

## It comes with the following attributes:

- **Question Text:** Freestyle, multiline text. The text field is read-only. The text indicates to the end-user what action will follow if they press the button.  

- **Optional:** Indicates whether this element is mandatory to be filled in at runtime. By default, this is not selected, and therefore the element is optional.  

- **Add Recipients:** Provides the ability to preload emails that can later be selected if desired.

- **Additional Title inside Email:** Provides the ability to preload additional titles inside the email.

## When using email elements in Acenji, keep these tips in mind:  
  
1. Enter the email address of the recipient in the "To" field. This is the person who will receive the email.  
  
2. Enter a brief description of the email's contents in the "Subject" field. This will help the recipient understand what the email is about.  
  
3. Write your message in the "Message" field. You can type anything you want here, but it's usually best to keep it concise and to the point.  
  
4. Click the "Send" button to send the email. You may be prompted to confirm the sending of the email before it is actually sent.  
  
Remember to double-check the recipient's email address and the contents of your email before sending it!
