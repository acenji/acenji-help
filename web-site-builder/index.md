# 🌐 Website Builder

The **ACENji Website Builder** is a **modern no-code super app builder** designed to create powerful, dynamic, and secure websites without writing a single line of code.  
It goes far beyond traditional site builders by combining **templates, workflows, user roles, and conditional access** into one platform.

Every website you build in ACENji is made of flexible **tiles** (reusable components), interactive **pages**, and dynamic **workflows**—all managed visually in a drag-and-drop environment.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

- **Template Tiles**  
  Create reusable design blocks that can be used across multiple sites and pages.  

- **Instances of Tiles**  
  Deploy tiles as live elements that can be individually customized while maintaining shared structure.  

- **User Authentication**  
  Secure pages and workflows with built-in login, signup, and access control.  

- **Group Sessions**  
  Enable collaborative or multi-user experiences, where access and roles define what participants can see or do.  

- **Variable Structures**  
  Attach data variables to any tile, page, or workflow to control visibility, behavior, and user interaction.  

- **Conditional Gates**  
  Advanced control mechanisms that trigger access or flow based on:
  - Time-based rules (start/end dates)  
  - Navigation history (previous page conditions)  
  - Tile or element values  
  - Internal or external variables  

- **Full No-Code Pages**  
  Each page is built as a **100% no-code HTML/JavaScript page** with interactive elements, making it highly flexible while still easy to manage.  

- **Embedding Options**  
  Publish sites as standalone projects, embed into **existing domains**, or integrate seamlessly with platforms like **WordPress**.
