# Cards

**What are Cards and how do they differ from Forms?**

First, let's define what Forms are. Forms are like worksheets that we use on computers. They help us fill in information in a certain order and then do something with it. ACENji is a special computer program that also uses forms, but once we fill them in, we can't change what we wrote and the different worksheets can't talk to each other or share information.   

Forms have been around for a long time and are used either as part of the server-side/OS or on the client-side by using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and then sending it to the server. In ACENji, which is a no-code language, we use forms for a descriptive flow with an eventual action or several actions in between or at the end. The results cannot be edited by users, and two forms cannot interact with each other, meaning that data cannot travel between them.

On the other hand, Cards are designed to be first-class citizens when it comes to communication and sharing information.   
## Here are some key points:

- Cards are individual apps.  
- Cards can blend and work together as one app.  
- Cards can share information with each other in real-time, either for a single user or for multiple users.  
- Cards have a hierarchy, meaning that one card may have more control over the other cards.  
- Cards can describe complex workflows.  
- The data generated from using apps constructed by cards can be viewed again, or viewed as a report and sent via email/SMS.  
- Cards come with a custom-made report system where reports can be built in minutes and outputted in PDF or CSV format.  


In contrast, forms are used for populating descriptive flow with eventually an action or several actions in between or at the end. Users cannot edit the results, and two forms do not know each other, data cannot travel around, and so on.

Overall, cards are a more advanced way of sharing and communicating information and allow for more complex workflows and data manipulation, while forms are more limited in their functionality.
