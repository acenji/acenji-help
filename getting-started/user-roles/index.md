# ðŸ‘¤ User Roles in ACENji

In ACENji, roles define what a user can access and manage. By assigning the right role, you can control permissions at both the **platform** and **project** levels.

## Available User Roles

**Platform Assign User** â€“ Assigned by an admin, has access to the full ACENji platform and multiple projects.

**Project Only User** â€“ Assigned by an admin, access is limited to specific projects only (apps).

**Self Registered User** â€“ Registers independently (web or mobile), access is scoped to the project they registered for.

**Guest User** â€“ No registration required. No platform account; interacts with a project directly as a public participant.

**Creator User** â€“ The original account owner who creates the ACENji account. Has the highest level of privileges for managing the platform and apps under that account.

**Admin User** â€“ Full administrative control over the workspace. Elevated access; sees more options on builder and config pages. Can assign other users with their roles.

**Manager User** â€“ Oversees teams, workflows, or departments. Project-level control role (planned).

**Staff User** â€“ Basic internal user with limited access. Usually, general employee-level access.

**Staff Deny** â€“ Denied access: may still appear in lists but cannot access the platform.
