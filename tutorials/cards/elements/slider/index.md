# Slider Element

Slider elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. The idea is to slide a scale with some units to indicate input. Example can be a scale that represent numbers from 1 to 100.

It comes with the following attributes


- **Qestion Text** - Free style, multiline text. The text field is read only. The text indicates to end user what information they need to add an an input. 
- **Default Value** - By default this element comes as an optional. Information can be placed here at design time or at run time via calculated field function (see below). Default value of 36.6 is assigned to help user what this represent as a hint.
- **Optional** - Indicate if this element is mandatory to be filled in at run time. By default this is not selected and therefore the element is mandatory. 
- **Min Value** - Indicates what is the starting point for the slider to be represented visually to the user.
- **Max Value** - Indicates what is the ending point for the slider to be represented visually to the user. 
- **Step Value** - Indicates when one unit is moved by the slider what that unit(step) is in value.
