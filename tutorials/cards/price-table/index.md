# Price Table - What it is  and how to use it?


<p>How the Price table works.The example is for the price range(the more complicated example), so the simplifying version will be a single price - just remove the price range. Forma start we will use several dropdowns, a quantity field, and a display price field.The final configurations look like this :</p>

<p>The above card example project demonstrates how the Price table works with a range of volumes</p>
<ol>
<li>For a start, we added label info on top that is just the title</li>
<li>Then added a drop-down called Select food category</li>

<!--around the images need to have empty line , otherwise for some reason do not dsiplay them-->

![image2](../../../images/food.jpg)

<p>Added three categories: Vegetables, Fruits, and Meat.Here is an example :</p>

<li>Next, we added another drop-down for selecting the food ingredients</li>

<p>There, select the Cascade Child checkbox and select &ldquo;Select food category&rdquo;</p>
<p>Added a few veggies. Ex.</p>

<li>Added numeric field we called quantity&nbsp;</li>

<p>We will use that field to tell how many items we are buying.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Added text field called display price</li>

<p>This field is auto-populated , no need to do anything&nbsp;</p>

<li>Added finally price element&nbsp;</li>

<p>The way you currently add price element is to drag it so it comes from the bottom of the cell phone a, without touching other elements</p>
<p>When you add that element it comes with few settings.</p>
<p>First, select the card and the card field you want the price to be against&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then select which card and field to display the price&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then select a single quantity or quantity range for the price:</p>
<p>Quantity range means that one item can have multiple prices based on volume.For example, range 1-10 price1, 11-20-price2, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Finally select the quantity field</p>
<p>That field is could be from another card and usually is input by users at run time&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you add the prices for each item. An example is eggplant prices below&nbsp;</p>
