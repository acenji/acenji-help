# 📘 Elements

**Elements are the foundational building blocks of every page in ACENji.**  
Think of them as the **ingredients** from which tiles, pages, and entire websites are created. Every visual feature you place on a page—text blocks, images, buttons, input fields, galleries, videos, and more—is an Element.

While there are many types of Elements (see the **[Website Elements](#/website-elements/index.md)** section for a full reference), all of them share a **common property system** that can be configured visually.

## 🧩 Elements and the Floating Design Panel

When you place an Element on a page, the **Floating Design Panel** appears.  
This panel lets you edit **all the properties** of the selected Element.  
It also clearly displays the **type of the Element** (e.g., *Info Box*, *Text Input*, *Text Area*) at the top of the panel so you always know what you are editing.

These properties are grouped into **tabs**, each focusing on a specific aspect of the Element’s behavior or appearance.

## ⚙️ Property Tabs Overview

Each Element supports the following property tabs:

- **General Tab**  
  The primary configuration area where you define the Element’s core behavior, identity, and settings.  
  → See the [General Tab](#/elements/general-tab.md) page for details.

- **Text Tab**  
  Defines the text content, formatting, variables, and styling (if the Element supports text).  
  → See the [Text Tab](#/elements/text-tab.md) page for details.

- **Events Tab**  
  Provides event-driven logic for your Element. Events are configured at **design time** and triggered at **runtime** (e.g., on click, on hover, on submit).  
  → See the [Events Tab](#/elements/events/index.md) section for details.

- **Connect Tab**  
  Used to bind the Element to data: assign variables, connect to in-memory data sources, or link to external workflows.  
  → See the [Connect Tab](#/elements/connect-tab.md) page for details.

- **Color Tab**  
  Controls the visual appearance of the Element. Choose colors for different layers and states.  
  → See the [Color Tab](#/elements/color-tab.md) page for details.

- **Dimensions Tab**  
  Defines the size and spatial behavior of the Element.  
  → See the [Dimensions Tab](#/elements/dimensions-tab.md) page for details.

- **Position Tab**  
  Controls the Element’s position within its row or layout container.  
  → See the [Position Tab](#/elements/position-tab.md) page for details.
