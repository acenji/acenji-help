# ⚡ Events Tab

The **Events Tab** in ACENji’s Floating Design Panel is where you define **dynamic behaviors** for any element — without writing a single line of code.

Using the Events Tab, you can configure actions such as **opening URLs**, **performing calculations**, **changing styles**, **linking to cards**, **cloning tiles**, or **deleting elements**, triggered by user interactions like clicks, hovers, or page events.

## 🧭 Where to Find It

1. Select any element on your ACENji page (e.g., a tile, button, card, or image).  
2. Open the **Floating Design Panel** on the right.  
3. Navigate to **Element Section → Events Tab**.

This will display a list of all event types you can attach to the selected element.

## ✨ Why Use Events

Events let you turn static UI elements into **interactive components** that respond to user behavior:

- 🔢 **Calculate** values and variables in real time  
- 🌐 **Open URLs** inside the same or new tabs  
- 🧭 **Navigate** between cards in your app  
- 🎨 **Change element styles** dynamically  
- 🧱 **Clone or delete tiles** to modify layouts live  
- 🔁 Chain multiple actions together on a single trigger

All configuration is done visually through simple forms—no custom JavaScript is required.

## 📚 Event Types Overview

The following event types are available under this section:

- [Calculate](./calculate/) — Perform math or variable operations on event trigger.  
- [Card Link](./card-link/) — Navigate to another card within your app.  
- [Change Style](./change-style/) — Dynamically change the style of elements when events occur.  
- [Clone Tile](./clone%20tile/) — Duplicate tiles dynamically.  
- [Delete Button](./delete-button/) — Delete specific tiles or elements.  
- [Open URL](./open-url/) — Open external or internal links.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tip

You can attach **multiple events to the same element**. For example:

> A button click can **calculate a score**, **change its background color**, and **navigate to a results card**, all in a single interaction.

This allows for sophisticated UI behavior without complexity.

## 🧪 Testing Events

- Event changes are saved immediately—no need to republish the app for every tweak.  
- If an event doesn’t fire, check the **trigger type** and ensure the correct **target element** is selected.
