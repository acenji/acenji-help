# 🌐 Website Builder

The **ACENji Website Builder** is a **modern no-code super-app builder** for creating dynamic, secure websites without writing any code.  
It combines **templates, tile-based design, workflows, user roles, and conditional logic** into one unified platform.

Every site is built from flexible **tiles** (reusable components), interactive **pages**, and dynamic **workflows**—all managed visually through a drag-and-drop interface.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

- **Template Tiles**  
  Create reusable design blocks that can be used across multiple sites and pages.  

- **Tile Instances**  
  Add tiles as live components on a page. Each instance can be customized without affecting the original template.  

- **User Authentication**  
  Secure pages and workflows with built-in login, signup, and access control.  

- **Group Sessions**  
  Enable collaborative or multi-user experiences where roles define what participants can see or do.  

- **Variables & Data Binding**  
  Attach data variables to any tile, page, or workflow to control visibility, behavior, and user interaction.  

- **Conditional Gates**  
  Trigger access or flow based on conditions such as:  
  - Time-based rules (start/end dates)  
  - Navigation history (previous page conditions)  
  - Tile or element values  
  - Internal or external variables  

- **Full No-Code Pages**  
  Each page is generated as standard HTML/JavaScript behind the scenes, while you design visually without coding.  

- **Flexible Publishing Options**  
  Publish sites as standalone projects, embed them on **existing domains**, or integrate with platforms like **WordPress**.

## 🧭 Example Use Cases

- Public websites with **conditional content access**  
- Training portals with **time-gated lessons**  
- Event sites with **role-based sessions** (attendees, moderators, admins)  
- Internal dashboards driven by **workflow variables**  
- Community hubs that adapt dynamically based on **user input**
