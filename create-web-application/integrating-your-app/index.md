# ⚙️ Integrating Your App

ACENji is designed to **live inside your existing website and domain** — so you can add powerful, role-aware features **without breaking current business flows**.

You can integrate ACENji with:

- **WordPress Web site** (via our plugin) → [WordPress Integration](./wordpress/index)
- **Any HTML/JavaScript Web site** (via a small embed snippet) → [HTML/JavaScript Integration](./html-javascript/index)

> 💡 Already using your domain for a live site? Perfect. ACENji embeds into domains that are **already in use** — no need for a new domain or a redesign.

## 🧭 Why integrate ACENji into your existing domain?

- **Protect your existing funnels**  
  Keep your SEO, analytics, and user habits intact. ACENji augments your site without forcing a rebuild.

- **Add true app logic to plain sites**  
  Most WordPress or HTML/JS sites **don’t support user roles, authorization, variables, or conditional views**.  
  ACENji adds all of this instantly — **no custom backend required**.

- **Scale progressively**  
  Start with one page or feature. Expand across your site when you’re ready, all on the **same domain**.

## 🔐 Align with User Roles (Recommended)

Before or after embedding, set up your **roles and permissions** so the right people see the right content:

- Define roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Member)
- Assign permissions and default access
- Map pages, tiles, or elements to roles

👉 See **[User Roles](../../getting-started/user-roles/index)** to configure this.
