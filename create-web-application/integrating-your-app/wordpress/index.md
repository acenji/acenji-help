# 🧩 WordPress Integration

ACENji can be added directly into your existing WordPress website — without changing your current pages or design.

You’ll build your web application inside ACENji (with all its pages, tiles, workflows, and logic) and then simply **connect it to WordPress using our plugin**.

This lets your users access your ACENji app **inside your own domain**, as if it were a natural part of your site.

## 🪛 Step 1 — Download and Install the ACENji Plugin

You can get the ACENji WordPress plugin in two ways:

- From the official [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.com/plugins)  
- Or by requesting it directly from us at [ACENji.com](https://www.acenji.com/contact)

Once you have the plugin file (`acenji_wp_plugin.zip`):

1. In your WordPress dashboard:  
   - Go to **Plugins → Add New**
   - Click **Upload Plugin**
   - Upload the `acenji_wp_plugin.zip` file
   - Click **Install Now** then **Activate**

## ⚙️ Step 2 — Confirm the Plugin is Installed

- Go to **Plugins → Installed Plugins**  
- You’ll see the plugin listed under **“ACENji Tech Solutions”** with its version and description

This confirms it’s active and ready to connect to your ACENji project.

## 📝 Step 3 — Enter Your ACENji Project ID

Each project you create inside ACENji has a unique ID.  
You’ll find it in the project URL inside your ACENji dashboard.

**Example:**
""https://www.acenji.com/admin/dashboard/visitors/618/web-card-builder""

In this example, the number **618** is your project’s ID.

- Copy this number
- In WordPress, go to **Settings → Membership Settings**
- Paste your ACENji Project ID into the field provided
- Click **Save**

> 🔐 ACENji uses strong authentication and authorization.  
> Exposing the ID is safe and does **not** affect security.

## 🧭 Step 4 — Add ACENji to Your Site Menu

The simplest way to give your users access to your new ACENji-powered app is to add it to your WordPress navigation menu:

1. Go to **Appearance → Menus**
2. In the **Available Links** list, you will now see your ACENji site listed
3. Select the ACENji link and **Add it to your menu**
4. Save the menu

Now your site has a direct link to your ACENji app.

## 🚀 Step 5 — Test the Experience

- Visit your WordPress site as a regular user
- Click the ACENji menu link you added  
- A **login screen will appear seamlessly inside your WordPress page**

![Click the "Start for Free" button](../../../../images/create-web-application/integrating-your-app/wordpress/pass-screen.png)

Once logged in, users are taken straight into your ACENji application — all within your own site’s layout and domain.

> 💡 This creates a seamless experience where users feel your ACENji app is **part of your website** — not a separate system.

✅ That’s it!  
Your ACENji web application is now live inside your WordPress site.
