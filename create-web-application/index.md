# 🌐 Create Web Applications

Building powerful, no-code web applications with ACENji starts with one key decision:
🧭 What kind of application are you creating?
Before you begin, consider the following questions:
🧩 1. What is the nature of your application?
New Application: Are you building a completely new app from scratch?
Add-On: Are you adding new functionality to an existing website or web application?
🔐 2. Who is the audience?
Internal: Used only by staff, admins, or restricted groups.
External: Used by customers, leads, or the public.
Mixed: Has both internal and external users, often with different views and access levels.

## 🏠 Seamless on Your Domain

“ACENji applications run inside your own domain — not ours.”
One of ACENji’s most powerful features is its native domain integration.
Your end users will never leave your website — they interact with the application as if it were built by you, on your own infrastructure.
Benefits:
🪪 Brand Trust: Users stay on your URL — no redirects to acenji.com or any external domain.
🕵️‍♂️ Invisible Embedding: The application is fully embedded, whether added to WordPress or any HTML/JavaScript site.
🔐 Secure & Isolated: Sessions, roles, and variable-based logic are scoped to your domain.
🧩 Custom Look & Feel: ACENji matches your existing branding — fonts, colors, headers — so there’s no visual disconnect.

## ⚙️ Integration Options
ACENji makes it easy to blend into existing platforms or standalone environments:
🧩 WordPress Integration
Use our free plugin to embed ACENji into your existing WordPress website. Your users will never notice it’s a separate application.
✂️ HTML/JS Integration
Paste a small JavaScript snippet into your current HTML site or web app to launch ACENji inside your layout — no disruption, no redesign needed.
🔗 ACENji apps are embedded directly into your domain — learn more in Seamless on Your Domain.
