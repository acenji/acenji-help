# üåê Create Web Applications

Welcome to the heart of ACENji ‚Äî where you can build complete, powerful **web applications without writing code**.

Whether you want to launch a **brand-new product**, add **new features to your existing website**, or create a **secure internal system for your team**, ACENji adapts to your vision.

---

## üß≠ Choose Your Starting Point

Before you start building, think about **what you want to achieve** ‚Äî ACENji supports every kind of project:

### üß© Build from Scratch  
Create a completely **new Web application** with its own pages, workflows, and brand identity.  
Perfect for launching new platforms, portals, or online services.

### üß© Add-On to an Existing Site  
Embed ACENji directly into your current website or app to **extend its capabilities**.  
You can add booking tools, dashboards, forms, or any interactive experience without disrupting your current design.

---

## üë• Choose Your Audience

ACENji apps can serve **any type of user group** ‚Äî all from the same platform:

- **Internal** ‚Äî for staff, admins, or private teams behind login  
- **External** ‚Äî for customers, leads, or the public  
- **Mixed** ‚Äî combine internal and external users with **role-based access** and **personalized views**

> üí° **Tip:** You don‚Äôt have to choose just one ‚Äî start small, and expand your app‚Äôs audience and features over time.

---

Next, you‚Äôll learn how to **integrate your app on your domain** and **start building with the Website Builder**.
 

## üè† Seamless on Your Domain

Most traditional site builders make you **start over on a new domain** ‚Äî creating a separate site that feels disconnected from your brand.  
Your users have to leave your website, go to another domain, and it‚Äôs clear the experience wasn‚Äôt built in-house.

**ACENji takes the opposite approach.**

üß© You don‚Äôt need a new domain.  
üß© You don‚Äôt need to rebuild your existing site.  
üß© You simply **add your new app directly into your current domain** ‚Äî so it becomes part of your website from day one.

---

### ‚ú® How It Works

**‚ÄúACENji applications run inside your own domain ‚Äî not ours.‚Äù**

Your end users will **never leave your website** ‚Äî they interact with your app as if it were built by you, on your own infrastructure.

**Benefits:**

- ü™™ **Brand Trust** ‚Äî Users stay on your domain, not redirected to `acenji.com` or any external platform.  
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Invisible Embedding** ‚Äî Works with WordPress, HTML/JavaScript, or any site ‚Äî no redesign or migration.  
- üîê **Secure & Isolated** ‚Äî Sessions, roles, and variable-based logic are scoped to your domain for full control.  
- üñåÔ∏è **Custom Look & Feel** ‚Äî ACENji inherits your existing branding (fonts, colors, headers) for a seamless user experience.

> üí° Start with a single page or feature inside your site. Expand as you grow ‚Äî all on your existing domain.
 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Integration Options

ACENji is designed to **fit into what you already have** ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs a full WordPress site or a simple HTML/JavaScript page.  
You don‚Äôt have to start over or hire a development team.  

There are two easy ways to bring your new app to life:

---

### üß© WordPress Integration  
If your website is built on **WordPress**, ACENji can plug right in.  
Use our free plugin to embed your application directly inside your existing pages ‚Äî no code, no disruption.

- Keep your current design and content  
- Add interactive ACENji apps alongside your existing pages  
- Manage everything from your WordPress dashboard

> üí° Users will never notice it‚Äôs a separate application ‚Äî it looks and feels like part of your site.

---

### ‚úÇÔ∏è HTML/JavaScript Integration  
If your site is **custom-built or uses plain HTML/JavaScript**, you can still add ACENji easily.  
Just paste a small snippet of code where you want the app to appear ‚Äî it launches inside your layout without changing your design.

- No need to rebuild or redesign  
- Works with any hosting platform  
- Add to one page or many

---

## üß∞ What ACENji Web Applications Can Do

ACENji gives you everything you need to build **real, multi-user web applications** ‚Äî not just static pages.  
It‚Äôs more than a site builder ‚Äî it‚Äôs a full platform for building interactive systems with users, permissions, logic, and automation.

Here‚Äôs what makes it powerful:

---

### üîê Secure Logins & User Roles  
Give people their own accounts to log in to your app.  
You control exactly **who can access what** by assigning **roles** (like Admin, Manager, Member) and managing **individual permissions**.

- Restrict certain pages or features to specific roles  
- Show or hide content based on who is logged in  
- Personalize experiences for each user

---

### üë• Groups & Timed Sessions  
Organize users into **groups** and control **when they can access your app**.  
For example, let one group in this week, and another group next week ‚Äî all automatically.

- Schedule start and end dates for group access  
- Run group sessions, courses, or cohorts  
- Track who belongs to which group at any time

---

### üìä Smart Variables & Dynamic Content  
Use ACENji‚Äôs **Variable Center** to store information about users or sessions and make your app respond to it in real time.

- Display different content based on user data  
- Turn features on/off dynamically  
- Trigger workflows based on variable values

---

### ‚ö° Conditional Logic & Page Control  
Control **which parts of a page are visible or interactive** based on conditions.

- Show or hide sections, tiles, or even individual elements  
- Create multi-step flows, gated pages, or time-locked content  
- Build interactive dashboards and workflows without code

---

### üß± Visual Builder & Event-Driven Design  
Build everything using a **drag-and-drop visual builder** ‚Äî no coding needed.  
Every element can respond to user actions like clicks, submissions, or selections.

- Design your pages visually  
- Link actions to triggers (e.g. ‚ÄúWhen user clicks, go to next page‚Äù)  
- Build forms, dashboards, portals, and more

---

> üí° In short: ACENji lets you build **secure, dynamic, user-aware applications** ‚Äî visually, and without writing a single line of code.
