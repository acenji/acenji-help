# Increment/Decrement Element

The Increment/Decrement element is used to increment or decrement a value using two buttons (+ and -). Increment/Decrement elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. The idea is to allow the user to click and increase or decrease the current value presented to them. The value typically starts at zero or some other initial value, and the user can increase or decrease it by a set amount (e.g., 1 or 10) with each button press. It is often used for shopping carts or inventory counts.

## It comes with the following attributes:

- **Question Text:** Freestyle, multiline text. The text field is read-only and indicates to the end-user what information they need to add as input.  

- **Default Value:** By default, this element is optional. Information can be placed here at design time, and a default value of 1 is assigned to help the user understand what this represents as a hint.  

- **Optional:** Indicates if this element is mandatory to be filled in at runtime. By default, this is not selected, and therefore the element is mandatory.  

- **Min Value:** Indicates the starting point for the slider to be represented visually to the user.  

- **Max Value:** Indicates the ending point for the slider to be represented visually to the user.  

- **Step Value:** Indicates what value is incremented or decremented when the user clicks the increment or decrement buttons. The default value of 1 is assigned.
