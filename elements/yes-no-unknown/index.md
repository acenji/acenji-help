# Yes, No, Unknown Element

A Yes, No, Unknown element is used to present a set of three mutually exclusive options that allow users to select one option at a time. Yes, No, Unknown elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. The idea is to provide users with a single choice from multiple sets of items that work like radio buttons. Users can create an unlimited number of items as part of the set. It's important to make sure that the options are easy to read and understand, and that the selected option is clearly indicated. You can also add options to customize the appearance of the element, such as changing the background color or font style.

## It comes with the following attributes:

- **Question Text:** A freestyle, multiline text field. The text is read-only and indicates to the end-user what information they need to add an input.

- **Default Value:** The user has the ability to preselect one of the set items.

- **Optional:** Indicates whether this element is mandatory to be filled in at runtime. By default, this is not selected and therefore the element is mandatory.

- **Values and Labels:** These two fields come as a pair. Users can overwrite the default three values and labels. **Keep in mind that no deselect option is allowed.**
