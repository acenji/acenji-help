# Multiple Selection Group Element

A multiple selection group element is used to present a set of options that allow users to select one or more options at a time. Multiple Selection Group elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. Users can choose to select one, two, or more out of many available items from a collection of predefined items. It's important to make sure that the options are easy to read and understand, and that the selected options are clearly indicated. You can also add options to customize the appearance of the element, such as changing the background color or font style.

## It comes with the following attributes:

- **Question Text:** Freestyle, multiline text. The text field is read-only. The text indicates to the end-user what action will follow if they press the button.  

- **Optional:** Indicates if this element is mandatory to be filled in at run time. By default, this is not selected, and therefore the element is mandatory.  

- **Options:** By default, the program will add one item with Option Text and option value. Users can add more after that.   
  - The **Option Text** is the text that will be displayed, and **Option value** is the value the system will use for any internal communications. It is okay for the pair to be the same or different.

- **MaxMultiSelect:** Defines how many items **CAN** be selected at the same time from the item collection.  

- **minMultiSelect:** Defines how many items **MUST** be selected at the same time from the item collection.  

- **Allow Deselect:** By default, this option is auto-selected. It gives the user an opportunity, after a selection is made, to revert it.
