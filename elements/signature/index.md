# Signature Element

The Signature element is used to allow users to provide their digital signature. Signature elements can be used in both **Forms** and **Cards**. They represent a widget combining a name and signature that is authentically preserved in a ledger to prevent fraud. The element is designed to accommodate a variety of device types and screen sizes, and any specific device requirements are clearly communicated. You can also add options to customize the appearance of the element, such as changing the color or thickness of the signature stroke.

## The signature element comes with the following attributes:

- **Question Text:** A freestyle, multiline text field that is read-only. This text indicates to the end-user what information they need to add as input.  

- **Optional:** An option to indicate if this element is mandatory to be filled in at run time. By default, this is not selected and therefore the element is mandatory.  

- **Placeholder:** A field used to specify an expected value in the input box. If empty, nothing will be displayed. By default, the value of **Placeholder** is assigned.  

- **Staff Signature:** Staff users can preload their signatures so that they already appear on the app screen.   
To do this, go to **Menu** -> **Settings** -> **Signature** -> sign your signature here. Click the **Confirm** button."
