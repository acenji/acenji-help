# Card Elements

**What are Card Elements?**

To start, let's first describe what forms are. Forms are like worksheets that we use on computers. They help us fill in information in a certain order and then do something with it. ACENji is a special computer program that also uses forms, but once we fill them in, we can't change what we wrote and the different worksheets can't talk to each other or share information.   

Forms have been around for a long time, either on the server-side/OS or on the client-side using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and then sending it to the server. In ACENji, we use forms to guide users through a descriptive flow that eventually leads to an action or multiple actions. Users cannot edit the results, and two forms cannot share data.

On the other hand, cards are designed to be first-class citizens when it comes to communication and sharing information.   
## The following are true about cards:

- Cards are individual apps.  
- Cards can blend and work together as one app.  
- Cards can share information between each other in real-time for a single user or other users.  
- Cards have a hierarchy, where one card may have more control over the other cards.  
- Cards can describe complex workflows.  
- Data from using the apps constructed by cards can be viewed again, or viewed as a report and sent via email or SMS.  
- Cards come with a custom-made report system where reports are built in minutes and the output is in PDF or CSV.  

In contrast, forms are used for populating descriptive flow with eventually an action or several actions in between or at the end. Users cannot edit the results, and two forms do not know each other, data cannot travel around, and so on.

Overall, cards are a more advanced way of sharing and communicating information and allow for more complex workflows and data manipulation, while forms are more limited in their functionality.
