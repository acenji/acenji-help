# Single Selection Group Element

A single selection group element is used to present a set of mutually exclusive options that allow users to select one option at a time. Single Selection Group elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. Users can choose one out of many available items from a collection of predefined items. It's important to make sure that the options are easy to read and understand, and that the selected option is clearly indicated. You can also add options to customize the appearance of the element, such as changing the background color or font style.

## It comes with the following attributes:

- **Question Text:** This is a freestyle, multiline text. The text field is read-only and indicates to the end-user what action will follow if they make a selection.  

- **Optional:** This indicates if the element is mandatory to be filled in at run time. By default, this is not selected and therefore the element is mandatory. 

- **Options:** By default, the program will add one item with an Option Text and an option value. The user can add more after that. The Option Text is the text that will be displayed and the option value is the value the system will use for any internal communications. It is okay for the pair to be the same or different.

- **Allow Deselect:** By default, this option is auto-selected. It gives the user an opportunity to revert their selection after it's made.
