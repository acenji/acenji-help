# Checkbox Element

A checkbox element is used to present a set of options that allow users to select one or more options at a time. Checkbox elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. Users are familiar with so-called "check boxes" and how data is selected or deselected. It's important to make sure that the options are easy to read and understand, and that the selected options are clearly indicated. You can also add options to customize the appearance of the element, such as changing the size or color of the checkbox.

## It comes with the following attributes:

- **Question Text:** A freestyle, multiline text field. The text field is read-only and indicates to the end-user what information they need to add as input.  

- **Required:** Indicates whether this element is mandatory to be filled in at runtime. By default, this is not selected and therefore the element is optional.  

- **Default Value:** By default, this attribute is selected. A default value is a value that is automatically assigned to a field or variable when no other value is specified. It is the initial value that is set by the system or the user, and can be changed later if needed. For example, if a checkbox element has a default value of "checked", it will appear as selected by default when the user opens the form or card. However, the user can uncheck it if they want to. The purpose of a default value is to provide a starting point for the user, to save them time and effort in entering data or making selections. 

- **Element Size:** This field is empty by default. Users can add a numerical value here to indicate the size of the info message in pixels. The lower the size, the more lines are allocated to the text in order to define that size as a box on the canvas.  

- **Inline:** A handy feature where, if selected, the element gets glued to the previous element on the canvas. If there is no space to be added to the previous element, it positions itself with its own dimensions at the beginning of the canvas on the row where it is located, and the next element can be glued to it.  

- **Calculated Field:** By default, this is not selected. If the user selects this option, the following image will open:

**The Calculated Field for Checkbox element works identically to how the [Info Element](../../tutorials/cards/elements/info/index.md) works.**

## When using checkbox elements in Acenji, keep these tips in mind:

1. When working with checkboxes in Acenji, it's important to use clear and concise labels for each option and present them in a logical order.   
  
2. Checkboxes are a common and recognizable visual indicator for selecting one or more options from a group, so they can help you easily make your selections.  
  
3. Consider providing additional context or instructions for the user about the meaning and use of the options, especially if it's not immediately clear what they represent.  
  
4. If there is a particular option that is commonly selected, you might consider setting it as the default option, so that it's already checked when the user sees the checkbox group. This can help guide the user and reduce errors or confusion.
