# GPS Element

The GPS element is used to allow users to capture location data using their device's GPS capabilities. GPS elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. The element is designed to accommodate a variety of device types and GPS accuracy levels, and any specific device requirements are clearly communicated. You can also add options to customize the appearance of the element, such as changing the size or color of the GPS indicator.

## It comes with the following attributes:

- **Question Text:** Freestyle, multiline text. The text field is read-only. The text indicates to the end-user what action will follow if they press the button.  

- **Optional:** Indicates if this element is mandatory to be filled in at run time. By default, this is not selected and therefore the element is optional.
