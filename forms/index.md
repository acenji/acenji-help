# Forms

What are **Forms** and how do they differ from **Cards**?

Forms are like a sheet of paper that you fill out to tell someone something or ask them for something. It's like when you write your name, age, and address on a piece of paper when you go to the doctor. But, when you use forms on the computer, you can't change what you wrote and the computer doesn't share your information with other forms. Forms are good for things like taking tests or placing orders online.

Forms have been used for a long time, either on the server-side or by using HTML on the client-side. In ACENji, we use forms as part of our no-code language to create a flow with an action at the end. However, users can't change the results, and forms can't share data with each other. They're good for assessments or one-way interactions like shopping carts, inventory lists, and orders.

Cards are like little computer apps that can talk to each other and share information. They can do things like help you organize your schedule or make a shopping list. Cards are more flexible than forms and can be used for more complex things like planning events or managing projects.
